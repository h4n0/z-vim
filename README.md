z-vim
=====

## About
[z-vim] is the `.vimrc` file for my personal use.
Anyone is free and welcome to clone, update or fork it.

## Quick Start
1. Set up [Git]

    This is probably done already since you're using Github.

    If not, for Debian based Linux users:
    `$ sudo apt-get install git`

2. Clone [z-vim]

    `$ git clone https://github.com/zhao-han/z-vim.git`

    And move `.vimrc` out to ~ directory

3. Set up [Vundle]:

    `$ git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`

4. Install Plugins:

    Launch `vim` and run `:PluginInstall`

    To install from command line: `vim +PluginInstall +qall`
